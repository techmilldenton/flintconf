- title: What is Hack NTX?
  content: Hack NTX is a hackathon where participants work together with city representatives to develop prototypes (or full applications) or validate civic problems that can be addressed through technology.
- title: Whatâ€™s a hackathon?
  content: A hackathon is a creative marathon all about building cool things. Participants listen to organizations present their problems, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in a day. We take these civic issues and smart city concepts and combine it with technology to make something impactful. It's a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills.
- title: Does it cost money?
  content: Nope! As an MLH Local Hack Day event, we're keeping it pretty lean. We will provide food on Saturday night, and drinks/snacks over the course of the day, but you just need to plan for lunch on Saturday (bring a lunch or we're right next to a lot of restaurants!)
- title: Timing
  content: Participants will arrive starting at 8am on Saturday December, 1 2018. You'll register, get coffee, and we'll start the project pitches right after. Hacking goes on all day and the closing ceremony will begin at 7pm.
