Over the years, Josh has been known for his uncanny ability to bring together creative misfits and inspire them to greatness. Swash Labs may not be the first instance of this phenomenon, but he does consider the business to be his greatest personal achievement. The biggest kick he gets out of being the CEO and President of his own Advertising Oasis is giving other motivated individuals the opportunity to thrive in a workplace they enjoy while making work they are proud of. THE ONLY REAL MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE IS NOT TO START.

Josh grew up in Cleburne, TX. In school he staked claim to the unspoken titles: King of Band Nerds and Unrepentant Lord of the English and Social Studies Departments. He went on to study film scoring and percussion performance at Berklee College of Music, which he abandoned a year into the program after suffering some surprisingly serious music-related injuries. He didnâ€™t let that stop him though, and powered through his schooling to acquire a Masters in Political Science and Behavioral Economics at the University of North Texas. He worked on building predictive violent risk analytics models and interned at a London political risk firm. This is where Josh truly became a data man.
