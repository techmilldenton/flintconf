Inspired by adventure, Emile Stewart went from living on a sailboat in the Bahamas to creating an internationally-acclaimed creative business. Wildflower Art Studio's products rank at the top of Amazonâ€™s Best-Seller list, with over 25,000 DIY Kits shipped across the globe. A recent magazine article explained that Wildflower Art Studio has pioneered the DIY industry with their unique Workshop-In-A-Box experience. Emile and her team opened Wildflower Art Studio's first Brick and Mortar in 2017, when thousands of DIY Kits literally outgrew her garage. As an artist, entrepreneur and mom of 2 wild little boys, Emile has mastered the art of embracing chaos.
