Emily Roden is the co-founder and CEO of ReadyRosie, the nation's leading family engagement resource for early childhood education. Emily started her professional career as an elementary music teacher in Plano ISD and Denton ISD before being recruited by Pearson Education as a consultant and eventually one of the region's top performing sales representatives. After the birth of her first child, Rosie, Emily combined her passion for education and her entrepreneurial drive with her new experience as a parent to start a company aimed at helping schools and families more easily partner together to improve outcomes for kids. 

ReadyRosie was birthed as an idea in her living room here in Denton in 2012 and is now being used by over 6000 schools in 48 states across the nation. Emily has been invited to the White House twice, has worked on projects through the Clinton Global Initiative, and is a sought-after national thought leader in the early childhood space. Emily is a proud graduate of UNT and now has three kids: Rosemary, Frank, and Pearl.
